# Choose Your Own Adventure

Create a [Choose Your Own Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure#Format) game. [Here](https://writer.inklestudios.com/stories/musgraveritual) is a fancy web-based example, but creating yours as text-only, command-line based is fine. You can use ASCII art if you're feeling...wait for it...*adventurous*.

See the [asciiart](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/asciiart) and [artii](https://github.com/miketierney/artii) gems.

Submit a pull request to this repository with all the necessary files, and replace this README with a description of your game and how to run it. Make sure to give the user instructions in the game about how to play, get help, etc.
